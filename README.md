LAB N5. Two-dimensional arrays.

Task:

Create an algorithm that solves individual task by using 2D arrays. Individual task number is being defined as in previous labs.
In Visual Studio environment create a console program in C/C++ based on created algorithm by using dynamic two-dimensional array of integer(!) numbers with size nxm (n and m are entered by user). Implement two ways of array filling: manual (array elements are entered by user) and automatic (array elements are random numbers generated in user specified range). User should be able to select a way of filling (for this create a menu for the user).
